# Network Slice Selection Function USER GUIDE
## Installation steps
### Windows

First of all, we need to install Python 2.7 . (Make sure to add python to the Environment Variables)

After that we need to run the following commands:
```
pip install ZODB
pip install ZEO
```

If you get an error while installing `ZEO` you need to install `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7` from: [C++ Compiler](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266).

After installing this dependencies and downloading/cloning the repository, navigate to `bjsonrpc/` folder in your `cmd` and run the following command:
```
python setup.py install
```
